# PE Payload Placement Experiments

**Goal:** Understand how different sections of a Portable Executable (PE) file can be used to store and execute additional code. This is a foundational step for evasion research and binary analysis.

## 🧪 Techniques Explored
### 1. [`.data` Section Placement](data_section/data.md)
### 2. [`.rdata` Section Placement](rdata_section/rdata.md)
- **Concept**: Store payload in the initialized data section.
